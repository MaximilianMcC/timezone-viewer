# Timezone viewer thing
Shows what time it is for other people, and also has a world ascii map that tracks the suns position.

## Preview thing
This is an example of the output at 9:18am nzst with two people added. You can see the orange sections represent the people tracked, and daylight is represented on the map (nighttime in the uk, day in nz)

> Running on Windows Terminal won't update the map, but will instead redraw it underneath (windows terminal issue, not me)
